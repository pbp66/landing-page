            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <section class="project-description">
                <p>I graduated from Purdue University with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. I started with ADM in June of 2017 where I started as a production engineer. Within one and half years, I was promoted to the role of a process engineer. I left ADM to pursue a role within operations management as a Process Lead at Ingredion. After one year in that role, I was promoted to Department Manager of the Corn Co-products department. A little over a year later, I'm transitioning to a senior engineer role. While I've learned and accomplished so much in the manufacturing role, I've realized that I enjoy computer programming so much more than what I learned with my original degree. Transitioning to a senior engineer will allow me to continue to provide value to Ingredion while I develop a software engineering skillset. </p>
                <p>At Purdue, I learned Java, Python, C, and MATLAB. On my own time, I've focused on C++ and some python, but I wanted to explore web development. I joined the University of Wisconsin Web Development Bootcamp to harness my previous knowledge and experience and apply it to the infrastructure of the internet. My personal website will act as an interactive host to my featured projects ranging from website, fullstack applications, desktop applications, and mobile apps. </p>
                <p> In my personal life, I enjoy skiing, hiking, programming, Home DIY, and snake-keeping. My wife is a veterinarian and together, we have 2 cats, 1 dog, and 2 snakes. Snakes are my favorite animal and I find them to be such unique creatures.</p>

                <p>User Story: As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.</p>
                <p>Acceptance Criteria: Given a generic webpage, when I view the source HTML and CSS, it contains semantic HTML elements that follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. When I view images, all accessible images contain descriptive alt text. When I view the heading attributes, they fall in sequential order. When I view the title element, I find a concise and descriptive title.</p>
                <p>This project serves to explore HTML and CSS elements focused on learning about semantic tags, logical flow, and reducing redundancy. I learned a lot about semantic elements and how CSS selectors work together. I did a lot of experimenting to see what I could and could not condense into as few selectors as possible. I researched several articles on alt text so it would be concise and descriptive for each image.</p>
