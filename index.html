            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <section class="project-description">
                <p>
                    I graduated from Purdue University with a bachelor's degree in
                    chemical engineering. I started with ADM in June of 2017 where I
                    started as a production engineer. Within one and half years, I was
                    promoted to the role of a process engineer. I left ADM to pursue a
                    role within operations management as a Process Lead at Ingredion.
                    After one year in that role, I was promoted to Department Manager of
                    the Corn Co-products department. A little over a year later, I'm
                    transitioning to a senior engineer role. While I've learned and
                    accomplished so much in the manufacturing role, I've realized that I
                    enjoy computer programming so much more than what I learned with my
                    original degree. Transitioning to a senior engineer will allow me to
                    continue to provide value to Ingredion while I develop a software
                    engineering skillset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At Purdue, I learned Java, Python, C, and MATLAB. On my own time,
                    I've focused on C++ and some python, but I wanted to explore web
                    development. I joined the University of Wisconsin Web Development
                    Bootcamp to harness my previous knowledge and experience and apply
                    it to the infrastructure of the internet. My personal website will
                    act as an interactive host to my featured projects ranging from
                    website, fullstack applications, desktop applications, and mobile
                    apps.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my personal life, I enjoy skiing, hiking, programming, Home DIY,
                    and snake-keeping. My wife is a veterinarian and together, we have 2
                    cats, 1 dog, and 2 snakes. Snakes are my favorite animal and I find
                    them to be such unique creatures.

                    User Story: As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows
                    accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search
                    engines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acceptance Criteria: Given a generic webpage, when I view the source
                    HTML and CSS, it contains semantic HTML elements that follow a
                    logical structure independent of styling and positioning. When I
                    view images, all accessible images contain descriptive alt text.
                    When I view the heading attributes, they fall in sequential order.
                    When I view the title element, I find a concise and descriptive
                    title.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This project serves to explore HTML and CSS elements focused on
                    learning about semantic tags, logical flow, and reducing redundancy.
                    I learned a lot about semantic elements and how CSS selectors work
                    together. I did a lot of experimenting to see what I could and could
                    not condense into as few selectors as possible. I researched several
                    articles on alt text so it would be concise and descriptive for each
                    image.

                    As a person wanting to improve their fitness, I want to have an
                    enjoyable and interactive experience that gives me the opportunity
                    to generate a workout for me to use. This will enable myself to
                    improve my fitness and keep track of my time of completion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Acceptance Criteria: Given the web application Body of Cards, when I
                    click on the timer, the timer starts. When I flip cards, I see a
                    card and a corresponding workout set. When I stop the timer, I am
                    presented with a record of my time in previous workouts along with
                    the exercises associated with that time. I expect to have a
                    different random workout each time, using hyperlinks to see videos
                    of exercises I don't know. I expect to record and time my progress
                    doing provided exercises.
